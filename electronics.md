## During class

As a courtesy to the instructors and other students, laptops will normally be closed, and cell phones will be in a bag. We are not trying to keep you from your lives, we just want to ensure you get the best class experience. If you want to take notes, an old fashioned notebook would be great. 

## During exercises, labs, etc. 
 Remember, in the getting help section, google is one of your first go-tos...just not during class time. Being mentally present, and not distracted will enable your learning process!
