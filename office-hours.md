# Office Hours

Office hours are generally from 1:30 to 2:30pm every week, always held in the student work area on the 8th floor. Nayana will be available for the first half hour and Lucy for the second. They're completely optional, but can be extremely useful!

The format is informal: the instructors "on duty" hang out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question, following the [guidelines on asking for help](asking-for-help.md). If everyone's having the same problem, the instructors may conduct an informal mini-lesson.

Hours for the evening TA will be posted shortly.
