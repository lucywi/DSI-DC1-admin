# Homework

## Things to note

- There will be roughly 2 hours of homework per night. Homework will take more time for some, and less time for others. It is up to you how you want to partition your time for a given exercise.

- Please read the [Incentives](incentives.md) for completing your homework on-time!

- Turn in **something**. Turning in an incomplete assignment is **infinitely** better than turning in nothing at all. We can't get you the help you need unless we see what you're working on. That said...

- **Late homework will not be accepted**. If you have issues submitting homework please let us know.

- You can track your homework completion rate in [Garnet](https://garnet.wdidc.org/).

## Due Dates and Grading

- You will generally be assigned homework every day. It will **all** be due **Friday afternoon at 5:05pm** BUT you are required to submit what you have completed so far, along with any questions, to the instructional team via Slack by Wednesday at 9am. If you do not submit material for the Wednesday check-in, you WILL NOT be able to receive more than
50 percent credit on the assignment. 


- Homework is graded only on **meaningful progress**. That is: that you made an effort to complete it, regardless of whether you were successful. **We would strongly prefer you spend 2 hours taking a good stab at it but not finishing, rather than spending 10 hours getting it perfect.** Each week, the homework will be reviewed and commented upon by your squad instructor. We will return feedback on Tuesdays at 9 am. 

- Labs are graded on whether or not you seem to have made a meaningful effort to do them. They are due at 9 am the next day. In general, feedback will not be given on these assignments by the grading instructor unless you specifically request it.  There are three possible grades for each assignment:
  - Complete: something was turned in, and meaningful effort was made.
  - Incomplete: something was turned in, but meaningful effort was not made: the submission is blank, or it was blatantly copied wholesale from somewhere.
  - Missing: nothing was turned in.
  
### In order to get feedback on your assignment...

- Ask specific questions, **ending them with a question mark**. We grade *lots* of assignments, and we rely on questions marks to provide a visual queue that we should stop and address something!

  For example:

  > Any thoughts as to why the method on line 49 kept returning 'NaN'?
