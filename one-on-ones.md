# Squad meetings

You will have a squad meeting with your squad instructor every week. These will be scheduled by your squad instructor.

They're a safe space to talk about literally anything. Squad meetings might include:
- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the squad meetings, so please come with questions prepared!

Squad meetings are usually 30 minutes. They can be longer or shorter depending on what needs you express.

We're **more than happy** to meet with you outside of the scheduled squad meeting times! Please just ask, either in-person or via Slack. You can request time from *any* instructor. If we can fit it into our schedules, we'll make it work!
