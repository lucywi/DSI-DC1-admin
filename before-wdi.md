### Important!

**Please complete the following steps as soon as possible.** We can't make classroom/squad assignments until you do!

1. **Click [this link](https://garnet.wdidc.org/).** This will authorize you for Garnet, an application that both instructors and students will use to track your progress throughout DSI.  

2. **Update your GitHub profile with your full name and profile picture.** The latter is very important - we need to know what you look like! The clearer the picture, the better.

3. **Take the [start of class survey](https://outcomes.generalassemb.ly/courses/19817/surveys/background/new).** This allows us to collect emergency contact and food allergy information.

4. **Complete the [outcomes prework]().** This will take you 30 minutes - 1 hour.

Once you're done, we encourage you to take a look through [this readme](https://github.com/lucywi/DSI-DC1-admin/blob/master/readme.md) if you would like to learn more about what you can expect out of DSI.

See you all Monday!
