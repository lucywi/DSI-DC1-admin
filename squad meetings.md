# Squad meetings

You will have a squad meeting with your squad instructor at the end of each week. They will typically run from 4:30 pm to 5 pm Fridays.

They're a safe space to talk about literally anything. Squad meetings will generally take the format of group members sharing a positive moment ('high') and negative moment ('low') they encountered in the past week. 

Squad meetings are usually 30 minutes. They can be longer or shorter depending on what needs you express.

You will also have a bi-weekly one-on-one meeting with our squad instructor. These will take place during our afternoon office hours and we will reach out to you a week in advance to notify you of your scheduled time. These individual meetings will also last half an hour. Topics covered during this time can include: 

- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!
